NAME
     pause -- stop until signal

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     pause(void);

DESCRIPTION
     Pause is made obsolete by sigsuspend(2).

     The pause() function forces a process to pause until a signal is received from either the kill(2) function or an interval timer.  (See setitimer(2).)  Upon
     termination of a signal handler started during a pause(), the pause() call will return.

RETURN VALUES
     Always returns -1.

ERRORS
     The pause() function always returns:

     [EINTR]            The call was interrupted.
